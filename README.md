# armour_set_searcher
A Linux alternative to Athena's Armour Set Searcher.

Disclaimer: This is not meant to replace the awesome program that is Athena's Armour Set Searhcer. It is meant for the people who do not have Windows and cannot run it. (I am aware Wine can run this program.)

My open source project aims to give some kind of program for the people who love Linux ^_^. I aim to keep this my project, so I do not plan to accept many / any pull requests. Feel free to fork this though, I am very happy to see people working with this, I just want to keep this repo mine.
