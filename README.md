# armour_set_searcher
A Linux alternative to Athena's Armour Set Searcher.

Disclaimer: This is not meant to replace the awesome program that is Athena's Armour Set Searhcer. It is meant for the people who do not have Windows and cannot run it. (I am aware Wine can run this program.)

My open source project aims to give some kind of armour searcher for the people who love Linux ^_^.
## How to run

Make sure you have all the requirements installed.
Run "python3 searcher.py"

## Thanks

Thanks to Bobbo from #monsterhunter (irc.freenode.net) for converting MHFU data to my format.

## Requirements

- Python3
- PyGtk (apt-get install python3-gi)
- clipit for copying armour sets to clipboard (apt-get install clipit)
- notify-send for notifying the user they have data in the clipboard.
